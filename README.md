# About

This project represents a new attempt at the social link aggregator service. It is modeled after (old)Reddit, HackerNews, and Lobste.rs trying to combine the good parts of these services while mapping them on the foundation of an [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub) generic service called [FedBOX](https://github.com/go-ap/fedbox).

It targets small to medium communities which ideally focus on a single topic. At the same it allows the community to reach other similar services and the rest of the fediverse ecosystem through the ability to federate.

The community can be built using an invitation based model, where a user shares the responsibility for moderating the other accounts they invited to the service. The moderation actions are kept public and presented in an anonymized layout.

Built using a performant stack, and with minimal dependencies, it tries to provide an easy out of the box installation.
